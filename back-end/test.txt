Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves developing algorithms and models that can understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Computer Vision is another important area of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It has applications in autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and security systems.

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It's used in game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.
